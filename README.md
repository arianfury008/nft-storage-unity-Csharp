# Unity NFT Storage Client
A client for "nft.storage" and "IPFS" APIs, written in C# and compatible with Unity Engine. This is edit code from another github : https://github.com/filipepolizel/unity-nft-storage#Edited

the problem with main code was limited to text file but with this script you can put any format file (mp4,zip,...)
Support **HttpClient** and **unityWebrequest** . Use whichever you want . **unityWebrequest** have upload progess too.

## Setup
For using this library, just copy the [NFTStorageClient.cs](./NFTStorageClient.cs) source code file to your Unity project, preferably alongside other scripts. As any regular Unity C# script, the main class defined in this library inherits Unity's [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) class.
